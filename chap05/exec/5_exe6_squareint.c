/*
Now modify the program of Programming Exercise 5 so that it computes the sum of
the squares of the integers. (If you prefer, how much money you receive if you
get $1 the first day, $4 the second day, $9 the third day, and so on. This looks
like a much better deal!) C doesnâ€™t have a squaring function, but you can use
the fact that the square of n is n * n.

	scanf("%d", &num);
	int sum = 0;

	while (count++ < num)

// Output:
// Enter an integer: 5
// The sum of the squares of the first 5 integers is 55
