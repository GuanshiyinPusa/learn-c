Chap 1
C is written by machine code
The implementation of C involves compiling and linking.
The compilers compile the code to immediate code,
    and the linker links the immediate code to the machine code.
The machine code is then executed by the computer.

So your code is combined with the start-up code(The code that works as an
        interface between the OS and the C code) and the standard library code
Then all three is called the machine code when brought together with linker.

Chap 2
5 types of statement in C language:
1. Declaration
2. Assignment
3. Function
4. Control
5. Null

Chap03
3 type of adjective keywords to modify int type:
1. short -- use less space
2. long -- use more space
3. unsigned -- nonnegative values

Chap04
1. C has no variable type for string, instead it's an array of characters.
2. The string is terminated by a null character '\0', C use it to determine the
    end of the string.
3. So the length of the string is the number of characters before the null
    character. 
4. The number of bytes is the length of the string plus 1.
5. Array is an ordered collection of elements of the same type.
5. The string is a pointer to the first character of the string.
6. string "x" and character 'x' are different. The former is an array of
    characters, the latter is a single character. "x" contains 2 characters,'x'
    and '\0'.
7. sizeof operator returns the number of bytes of the variable; strlen
    function returns the number of characters of the string.
8. The scanf function uses whitespace to separate the input, so it can't read
    the string with whitespace. However, %c can read the whitespace.:q
