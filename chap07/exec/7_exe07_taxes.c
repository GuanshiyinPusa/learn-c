/*
Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the
gross pay, the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following: a. Basic pay rate =
$10.00/hr b. Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half c. Tax rate:
#15% of the first $300 20% of the next $150 25% of the rest Use #define
constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to current tax law.
