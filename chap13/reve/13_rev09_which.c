// The "a+", "r+", and "w+" modes all open files for both reading and writing.
// Which one is best suited for altering material already present in a file?
// Answer: "r+" is best suited for altering material already present in a file.
// Correct:
// The "r+" mode lets you read and write anywhere in a file, so itâ€™s best
// suited. The "a+" mode only lets you append material to the end of the file,
// and the "w+" mode starts with a clean slate, discarding previous file
// contents.
