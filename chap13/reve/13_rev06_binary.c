// Whatâ€™s the difference between binary files and text files on the one hand
// versus binary streams and text streams on the other?
// Answer: Binary files are files that store data in a format that is not
// human-readable. Text files are files that store data in a format that is
// human-readable.

// Correct:
// The distinction between a binary file and a text file is a system-dependent
// difference between file formats. The distinction between a binary stream and
// a text stream consists of translations performed by the program as it reads
// or writes streams. (A binary stream has no translations; a text stream may
// convert newline and other characters.)
