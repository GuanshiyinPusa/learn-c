// Write a program that takes as command-line arguments a character and zero or
// more filenames. If no arguments follow the character, have the program read
// the standard input. Otherwise, have it open each file in turn and report how
// many times the character appears in each file. The filename and the character
// itself should be reported along with the count. Include error-checking to see
// whether the number of arguments is correct and whether the files can be
// opened. If a file canâ€™t be opened, have the program report that fact and go
// on to the next file.
// ./a.out a 13_exe09_modify2.c 13_exe08_count.c
// 'a' appears 24 times in file 13_exe09_modify2.c
// 'a' appears 69 times in file 13_exe08_count.c
