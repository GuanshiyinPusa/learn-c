/*
Write a program that creates two eight-element arrays of doubles and uses a loop
to let the user enter values for the eight elements of the first array. Have the
program set the elements of the second array to the cumulative totals of the
elements of the first array. For example, the fourth element of the second array
should equal the sum of the first four elements of the first array, and the
fifth element of the second array should equal the sum of the first five
elements of the first array. (Itâ€™s possible to do this with nested loops, but by
using the fact that the fifth element of the second array equals the fourth
element of the second array plus the fifth element of the first array, you can
avoid nesting and just use a single loop for this task.) Finally, use loops to
display the contents of the two arrays, with the first array displayed on one
line and with each element of the second array displayed below the corresponding
element of the first array.

		arr2[i] = sum;
	}

	for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
		printf("%.2f ", arr1[i]);

	printf("The second array: ");
	for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
		printf("%.2f ", arr2[i]);
	}
	printf("\n");
