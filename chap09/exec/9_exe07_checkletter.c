/* Write a program that reads characters from the standard input to end-of-file.
For each character, have the program report whether it is a letter. If it is a
letter, also report its numerical location in the alphabet. For example, c and C
would both be letter 3. Incorporate a function that takes a character as an
argument and returns the numerical location if the character is a letter and
that returns â€“1 otherwise. */

		// Subtract ASCII value of 'a' and add 1 to get the position in the
