// In question 1, ref is the address of what? What about ref + 1? What does
// ++ref point to?
// ref is the address of the first element of ref[], therefore
// the address of 8. ref + 1 is the next element of the ref[], therefore 4.
// ++ref is add first and then take ref into account, therefore the same as ref
// + 1, so 4
